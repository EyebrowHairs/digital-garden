# ðŸ“» Chrono-Radio

I like to keep a timeline of music that has caught my attention. It can be quite difficult to find a particular piece if I didn't pay attention to the name, especially with classical or instrumental music, hence a chronological timeline helps to jog my memory!&#x20;

My musical tastes vary, but mostly center around classical music, the 70/80/90â€™s genre, and others that will turn up here eventually ðŸŽµ

Entries are in reverse chronological order (newest at the top).
