Welcome to my digital garden 🌱

I've never been great at remembering all the useful advice I've encountered over the years, so I decided to start this public knowledge repository to store my learnings (among other things) and also share them with others.

Additions may be infrequent, as I will put more effort into the quality of content.

Enjoy! Feel free to&#x20;
