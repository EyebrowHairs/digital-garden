### About this Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

#### Principles

Honestly, I can't remember how I first encountered the concept of a digital garden. However, there is a [list of articles](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#theory-philosophy-and-navel-gazing) (handily collected by Maggie Appleton) that provides somewhat of a history of the idea, most of which I have read to form my own conception of what a digital garden is.&#x20;

**My digital garden...**

* **Contains** [**curated**](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) **ideas and online content that I'd like to revisit**. I have opted to share this publicly as a means of sharing knowledge, and also as a source of motivation (to create useful things for others).
* **Can include items on any topic**. I can curate content on any theme or topic, whatever suits my interest, and it can all live harmoniously (I hope) in this space.
* **Is a work in progress**. All pages can be updated and revised at any time (and not even regularly).
* **Is not quite a blog** where each article is highly polished before being published. Neither is the content presented [chronologically](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/). I'm also not concerned with racking up views or writing purely to monetize (which I believe is a waste of human effort and digital space).

#### Platform

I've tried several times to wrangle together a digital garden with Jekyll and other static site generators, but unfortunately, I didn't have much success in learning all the little ins and outs to customize it to my desires and also maintain it.&#x20;

Ultimately, I wanted a documentation-style layout for my digital garden, so I've settled on Gitbook, which offers a WYSIWYG editor so I don't even have to worry about getting any styling (typically in Markdown) correct before publishing pages.

There are several constraints to Gitbook, such as the inability to customize things such as colours and fonts for free, or to add cool features such as [side/margin notes](https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes), or [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).

However, on the plus side, my content is not entirely tied to this system, as I am able to sync the files (in .md format) to a [Github repository](https://github.com/EyebrowHairs/digital-garden). Also, there is something about constraints that are somehow more liberating, as all I have to focus on is _creating_ the content, rather than being distracted by the myriad of ways I can theme or format my content.

#### Inspiration

* [A huge list of other digital gardens](https://github.com/lyz-code/best-of-digital-gardens)
* [Tom Critchlow's wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) - I have always been fascinated by this because it has such a wide variety of topics
* [Maggie Appleton's garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) is just so beautifully designed (both visually and organizationally) \*tears of joy\*
