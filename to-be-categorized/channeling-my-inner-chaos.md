# Channeling My Inner Chaos

I've been wondering lately whether I have ADHD, as I've had a long history of procrastinating, project-hopping (and abandoning), affinity to instant-gratification projects, and ability to focus for hours on end on a book or project that has caught my interest. I also despise having to subject myself to a self-imposed schedule or routine, which is a bummer because some things in life do need regular maintenance and upkeep.

In retrospect, I suppose I subconsciously realized these things when I embarked on a journey to learn the violin back in 2018. A few months into learning the violin, you are at a stage when you generally sound horrible (think screechy), but require repeating exercises and drills until you sound relatively acceptable. It's a long and painful journey - and one I suspect I may have given up on if I hadn't decided to take action.&#x20;

I used a few tactics: public accountability, community, and visualization.
